I am a PhD Candidate at the Erasmus School of Economics (Erasmus University Rotterdam). My research explores how environmental and policy factors shape health, education, and welfare, combining causal inference methods with large-scale survey and environmental data.

My supervisors are [Teresa Marreiros Bago d'Uva](https://www.eur.nl/en/people/teresa-marreiros-bago-duva) and [Hans van Kippersluis](https://sites.google.com/site/hansvankippersluis/)
